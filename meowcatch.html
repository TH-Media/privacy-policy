  <h1>Privacy Policy for Meow Catch – Games for Cats</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-09-03</p>

  <p>
    Meow Catch – Games for Cats (the “App”) is an entertainment app. We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about how information may be handled when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No account or personal details:</strong> The App does not create user accounts and does not ask you to provide personal information (such as name, email, phone number, or address).</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising identifiers &amp; interactions:</strong> The App uses third-party advertising services (Google AdMob). These services may collect device information such as the <em>Advertising ID</em> and basic interaction events (e.g., ad impressions/clicks) to deliver and measure ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may show ads via Google AdMob. Data collected by AdMob is processed under Google’s own policies:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li>AdMob &amp; Google Mobile Ads: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob policy &amp; data</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not control how these third parties use the data they collect. Please review their policies for details.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use and Share Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell personal information.</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers and interaction signals may be <strong>shared with AdMob/Google</strong> to display, personalize, and measure ads.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Security &amp; Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Network communications made by the App and AdMob use modern encryption in transit (e.g., HTTPS). The App itself does not store personal data. Any retention performed by third-party providers follows their own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected personal data from a child, please contact us and we will address the issue promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Reset/Limit Ads Personalization (Android):</strong> On your device go to <em>Settings → Google → Ads</em> (or <em>Privacy → Ads</em>), then reset the Advertising ID or turn off ad personalization.</li>
    <li>If the App presents a consent dialog (Google UMP), you can manage your ad consent there.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
  </p>
